/*
 Most simply just explicilty encode the type you want, single or double.
 This works easily everywhere since standard C supports both
 these types and so does qcbor.  This encoder also supports
 half precision and there's a few ways to use it to encode
 floating point numbers in less space.
 
 Without losing precision, you can encode a single or double
 such that the special values of 0, NaN and Infinity encode
 as half-precision.  This CBOR decodoer and most others
 should handle this properly.
 
 If you don't mind losing precision, then you can use half-precision.
 One way to do this is to set up your environment to use
 ___fp_16. Some compilers and CPUs support it even though it is not
 standard C. What is nice about this is that your program
 will use less memory and floating point operations like
 multiplying, adding and such will be faster.
 
 Another way to make use of half-precision is to represent
 the values in your program as single or double, but encode
 them in CBOR as half-precision. This cuts the size
 of the encoded messages by 2 or 4, but doesn't reduce
 memory needs or speed because you are still using
 single or double in your code.
 

 encode:
    - float as float
    - double as double
    - half as half
 - float as half_precision, for environments that don't support a half-precision type
 - double as half_precision, for environments that don't support a half-precision type
 - float with NaN, Infinity and 0 as half
 - double with NaN, Infinity and 0 as half
